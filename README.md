### About me:
ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on: My personal website, where I'm exploring new design ideas and showcasing my projects.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: Linux, diving into the world of open-source operating systems and server management.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on: Although I've never collaborated before, I'm open to new opportunities and excited to work with others on interesting projects.

ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with: Nothing specific at the moment, but I'm always open to learning from others and sharing knowledge.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: Anything you'd like! Whether it's web development, Linux, or anything else, I'm here to help.

âš¡ Fun fact: I enjoy experimenting with different programming languages and technologies in my free time.


### my projects:

- My dotfiles - not public yet, but I'm planning to share my dotfiles, which I use to customize my Linux and macOS environment.
- this README - I'm planning to improve this README by adding more information and making it more visually appealing.

### future projects:
